# ECE 458: Communication Networks

## Course Objectives
This course will introduce the fundamental concepts in computer communications networks, to help students understand the principles and practices of designing, building, and operating computer networks, particularly the Internet securely and effectively.

## Learning Outcomes
    • Describe the layered network protocol architecture.
    • Outline the Link Layer services, protocols, and resource management mechanisms including error detection and correction, addressing, flow control, medium access control, CSMA/CD and CSMA/CA.
    • Outline the Network Layer services and protocols including IP addressing, unicast and multicast routing, IP, and ICMP.
    • Outline the Transport Layer services, protocols, and control mechanisms, including multiplexing/demultiplexing, end-to-end error control, flow control, and congestion control, TCP and UDP.
    • Use network traces to analyze the protocols.
    • Outline the Application Layer and the policies and mechanisms used in process communication including client/server, peer-to-peer and sockets. Describe how web, DNS work.
